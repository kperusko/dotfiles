Installation of ZSH and oh-my-zsh.

To install use the install.sh script. This is inteded for Ubuntu 12.x+

```sh
curl --user kperusko https://github.com/kperusko/dotfiles/raw/master/zsh/install.sh | sh
```

OR you can use wget if curl is not installed

```sh
wget --user=kperusko --ask-password https://github.com/kperusko/dotfiles/raw/master/zsh/install.sh
sh install.sh
```
